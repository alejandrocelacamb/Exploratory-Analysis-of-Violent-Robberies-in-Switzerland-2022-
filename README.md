# Exploratory Analysis of Robberies in Switzerland (2022)

This repository contains an exploratory analysis focusing on violent robberies in Switzerland during the year 2022. The analysis is carried out using Python, leveraging libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Contents

- **crime.ipynb**: Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- **data/swiss_crime_2008_2022.xlsx**: Excel file with violent crimes data in Switzerland from 2008 to 2022. For this project, we focus solely on the 2022 data concerning robberies.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Data

The dataset, titled **violent crimes**, is sourced from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and includes records from 2008 through 2022. In this analysis, only the data for 2022 related to robberies (both simple and violent) is examined to extract insights and trends.

## Analysis

The analysis performed in the notebook includes:
- Loading and cleaning the 2022 data from the Excel file.
- Extracting insights specifically on robberies (simple and violent).
- Comparing rates and trends between simple robberies and violent robberies.
- Visualizing the data with `matplotlib` to highlight patterns and distributions.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl



## Execution

To run the analysis:
1. Clone the repository:
